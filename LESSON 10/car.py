# OOP -> Object Oriented Programming

# class => wrapper data + methods to work with that data
# class -> data + ways to work with that data

# data -> variable
# ways to work with data -> function

# A class acts as a 'blueprint' for custom types in python.  The blueprint will define the structure, design, and features
# that all houses of that type should have. In Python, a class is like that blueprintâ€”it defines a new type of object
# with its own attributes (characteristics) and methods (actions or behaviors).

# self -> reference to the object created by the type (class)

class Car:
    # variable -> attribute
    model = ""
    color = ""
    manufacturer = ""
    is_running = False

    # constructor -> the first METHOD (function) called when an object is instantiated (created)
    def __init__(self, model, color, manufacturer):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.manufacturer = manufacturer

    def start_car(self):
        if self.is_running == False:
            self.is_running = True

        else:
