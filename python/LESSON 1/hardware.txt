Q: How does my computer understand python code?
A: It doesn't. The PC (processor) understands only binary (zeroes and ones)

Q: How does your computer transform python text (code) to binary
A: There is a program (python.exe) which transforms your code into binary. It's called a compiler / interpretator

Compiler: reads the whole file at once and can do optimizations
Interpretator: reads your file line by line and executes it line by line

C++ is a compiled language
Python is an interpreted language

High level vs low level languages:
    low level - closer to the processor (binary) C/C++/C#/Assembly those languages requrie more from the developer. Very fast!
    high level - more abstractions Python, JavaScript. They ease the development of applications and are slower than low level languages 

Dynamically typed languages - languages that do NOT require explicit typing

Convention: the usual way of doing things
Integer - цяло число

Explicit - ръчно трябва да го направиш
Implicit - програмата го прави за теб
