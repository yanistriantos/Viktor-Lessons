Types of CSS selectors:

!!! Will use those 3 mainly !!!

Element (type) selector: 

p {
    color: blue;
}

Class Selector: Selects all elements with a specific class attribute.


.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

ID Selector: Selects the element with a specific ID. Since IDs are unique, this should only apply to one element.

#main-title {
    font-size: 24px;
}

Attribute Selector: Selects elements based on an attribute or attribute value.

input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid grey;
}

! Pseudo selectors are improtant (:hover, etc...)

Pseudo-class Selector: Selects elements in a specific state, e.g., :hover, :first-child.

a:hover {
    color: red;
}

Pseudo-element Selector: Selects part of an element, e.g., ::before, ::after.

p::first-line {
    font-weight: bold;
}

!!! IMPORTANT

Descendant Selector: Selects elements that are descendants of another specified element.

div p {
    color: green;
}

Child Selector: Selects direct child elements only.

ul > li {
    padding: 5px;
}

Adjacent Sibling Selector: Selects an element that is directly after another specific element.
h1 + p {
    margin-top: 0;
}

! Probaby will never use this one :D

General Sibling Selector: Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.

h1 ~ p {
    color: blue;
}

Specificity Calculation
Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied by the browsers when multiple rules could apply to the same element.
It's calculated based on the types of selectors used in a rule:

Inline styles: Applied directly within an HTML element (specificity: 1,0,0,0)
IDs: (specificity: 0,1,0,0)
Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes: (specificity: 0,0,1,0)
Elements and pseudo-elements: (specificity: 0,0,0,1)

Inline style > ID > class, attribute, pseudo-class > plain elements and pseudo-elements
