HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is almost an language :D which is the most basic building block of the web
It is called markup because it defines (marks) the structure of the web page

What is a web page? A structure of text and sections

We split our web page into two semantic parts:
    1. The metadata (head tag)
    2. The actual markup (body tag)
and wrap all this in an html tag 

a tag is simply the syntax of html to define a node (something) on the web page we are building (node === something on the page)
an element is a tag which first opens e.g. <p> Hello </p> and then closes the <p> is the opening of the tag and the </p> is the closing

void elements -> elements with no displayable content:
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="An image of the firefox logo" />
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

Anatomy of the structure of an HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html> - required preamble was useful in the 90s and it is just a requirements nowadays
<html></html> - wraps (обвива) all the content of your web page. Sometime referred as the 'root' element
<head></head> - metadata
<body></body> - all the content that you want to show to the viewers of your web page 

attribute - provide additional information about an html element e.g. src and alt attribtes on the img element

Headings: <h1> - <h5> - association with book chapter headings, subheadings, etc...

Comments: <!-- <comment> --> (weird compared to other LANGUAGES' comment syntax)

Paragraphs (text element): <p>Hello</p>
Inline paragraph (inline text element): <span>Hello</span> 

Lists:
    1. Ordered Lists <ol> - order matters (recipe)
    2. Unordered Lists <ul> - order doesn't matter (shopping list)

    Each item inside a list is wrapped by a <li> (list item) element
