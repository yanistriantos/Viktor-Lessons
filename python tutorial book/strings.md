**Text**

Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the '+' operator, and repeated with '*':

```
# 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
output'unununium'
```
Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0

Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:

```
word[-1]  # last character

word[-2]  # second-last character

word[-6]
```
