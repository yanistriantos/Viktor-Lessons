# Exercise Suite: Python Standard Libraries & File Manipulation

## Exercise 1: Working with the `os` and `shutil` Libraries

**Task:**  
Using the `os` library, list all files and directories in the current working directory. Then, create a new directory named `test_dir` using the same library. After that, with the help of the `shutil` library, move all `.txt` files from the current directory into the newly created `test_dir`.

- **Key Libraries:**
  - `os`: Used for interacting with the operating system, such as navigating the file system and creating directories.
  - `shutil`: A utility library for high-level file operations like copying and moving files.

## Exercise 2: Manipulating CSV Files with the `csv` Library

**Task:**  
Read data from a CSV file that contains student names and their grades in various subjects. Compute the average grade for each student, and then write the results (student name and their average grade) to a new CSV file. This task involves reading, processing, and writing CSV data.

- **Key Library:**
  - `csv`: A standard Python library used for reading from and writing to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.

## Exercise 3: JSON Handling with the `json` Library

**Task:**  
Read data from a JSON file, modify one of its fields (such as updating a user's age), and then write the modified data back into the JSON file. This exercise helps in understanding how to work with JSON objects in Python—loading, updating, and saving data.

- **Key Library:**
  - `json`: A library used for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), allowing easy parsing, reading, and writing of JSON data.

## Exercise 4: Working with the `datetime` Library

**Task:**  
Generate a log file that records the current timestamp every time the script is run. Append a new log entry with the timestamp to the file each time the script executes. This exercise shows how to work with timestamps and logging in Python.

- **Key Library:**
  - `datetime`: Provides classes for manipulating dates and times, useful for generating timestamps.

## Exercise 5: File Search and Manipulation with `os` and `shutil` Libraries

**Task:**  
Search for all files with a `.log` extension in the current directory and move them to a backup folder. If the backup folder does not already exist, create it. This exercise combines file searching and moving, using both the `os` and `shutil` libraries.

- **Key Libraries:**
  - `os`: For interacting with the file system to search for files and check directory existence.
  - `shutil`: For moving files from one directory to another.

Each exercise in this suite reinforces important file manipulation skills using Python’s standard libraries, which are essential for tasks like navigating file systems, processing CSV and JSON data, handling timestamps, and moving files.
